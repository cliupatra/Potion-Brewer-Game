# Potion Brewer Game

## What is my project about?

I will be making a game about brewing potions while set in a fantasy background. The application will allow users
to make **potions** using various ingredients and sell them for money. Users will be able
to *discover* new potion recipes and ingredients through **reading** books. These books can be obtained from buying them
from a **bookstore**. Additionally, users will be able to keep a list of potion recipes and make **new** potions after obtaining recipes.
People who will use my application will most likely be fantasy enthusiasts and people who like to create *unique* concoctions.
This project is of interest to me because I always liked magic and fantasy related subjects. I thought it would be fun to try to create a potion brewing game
where I could discover **new** recipes and make **different** potions.
